<h2>Let's take a closer look!</h2>
<h3>Jugotron</h3>
<p>Formed in Zagreb in 1947, Jugotron is a powerhouse of the Yugoslav pop-rock scene. After the fall of Yugolsavia, 
Jugotron's name was changed to Croatia Records. This label had the rights to sell the music of many international stars such as:
The Beatles, David Bowie, and Elvis Presley.
</p>
<h3>Diskoton</h3>
<p>Established in Pionirska Dolina in 1972, Diskoton changed the way the world sees Yugolsav muisic.
    The offices of Diskoton were located in a popular city park and zoo maintained by public city services.
    Their first pieces of equipment were French-made automatic pressing machines.
    With the Bosnian wars only getting more intense, the company failed to stay afloat and closed their doors forever in 1992.
</p>
<h3>ZKP RTLJ</h3>
<p>ZKP RTLJ, founded in 1981, was the music production of the state-sanctioned national broadcaster Radiotelevizija Ljubljana.
    In 1990, at the start of Yugoslavia's break up, the company was renamed Zalozba Kaset in Plosc RTV Slovenija.
    The company had the rights to release albums by Bruce Springsteen, Depeche Mode, and Blondie to the Yugoslav public.
    A large shift in upper management occured in 1984 when the owner and founder Cvitko Volny was found dead in mysterious circumstances.
</p>
<h3>Suzy</h3>
<p>Established in 1972 in the city of Zagreb, Suzy alternated between three different logos. The first in use from 1972-1974, the second from 1974-1989, and their third and current logo 
    has been in use from 1989 to present day. Suzy had the rights to sell the music of artists such as Cyndi Lauper, Santana, and Rod Stewart.
    Though Suzy took longer than most labels to rise to success, in many ways it outshone it's competitors.
